# ReducedAdventure_MARS

Very crude and bare-minimum implementation of the
["Adventure" Atari game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_(1980_video_game))
in MIPS ASM through the Mars simulator (http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars).

This project was developed many years ago when I was an undergrad. I haven't touched it since then and there are no plans to develop it further at the moment.

# Instructions

- Use MARS' Keyboard and MMIO Simulator to input keys to the game
- Use NUMPAD DIRECTIONALS to move the player
- Use HEAP MEMORY as the starting point for Bitmap Displaying
- Pixels should be 16x16 wide
