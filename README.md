# ReducedAdventure_MARS
MARS' MIPS reduced implementation of the Atari game Adventure

This game was developed purely for the sake of completing a grade on my course and has no expectations of being fully developed for the time being.

#Instructions
- Use MARS' Keyboard and MMIO Simulator to input keys to the game.
- Use NUMPAD DIRECTIONALS to move the player.
- Use HEAP MEMORY as the starting point for Bitmap Displaying.
- Pixels should be 16x16 wide.
